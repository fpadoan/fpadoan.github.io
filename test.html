<h1>Hello, Basecamp!</h1>

I am Fernando Padoan, from Brazil, and I want to lead the Android charge on Basecamp.

I’m a Developer working with Android and other stuff, and here is why I think we should work together.

<h2>A few facts about myself</h2>

Father, husband, brother, friend, and a bit of a geek. I like to draw, play the guitar, travel, watching (and talking about) movies and reading, be it comics, general fiction or technical books and blogs. I also enjoy making quick home improvements, DIY-style.

<h2>My work</h2>

Working full-time with software development for some time now, half of it in the current company, C.E.S.A.R. Have also been in a lead developer in several projects, most of them for mobile. I’m really into making and help people make decisions and validate ideas to solve problems in software.

I look to know the motivation for whatever it is I’m doing, so I won’t just start working on something that I can’t see how people will use. It feels much more engaging for me to work that way than in an isolated component that someone else will integrate to their thing later on, and all I need to know is what it is expected to do with certain input.

I like to contribute my ideas whenever I feel it is of good use, and I prefer validating or discussing it with the team to just enforcing it based on my own perception. I also value and respect the efforts in good design and usability, so I work with designers, never against them.

I really enjoy helping people, and I have lead and mentored peers in different projects all over the span of my time in the current job (see some testimonials at the end of this page).

<h2>Why leave</h2>

My current employer is an institute for R&D in technology and innovation, with a good work environment and culture. I’m very proud of my years working for them, but I’d like to experience working in a product company, instead of doing consulting projects where clients are always companies and there’s never time to improve the existing solution.

I would like to have the opportunity not only to implement and deliver, but also to iterate over the working software, adding or improving its features and evolving its construction as needed. I’m seeking a sense of commitment that it’s greater than what projectized consulting can provide, even if I’m all in with the project goals (and I always am).

<h2>Why Basecamp</h2>

From what I read in your books, blog, talks, etcetera., I think Basecamp is the place to find that feeling of inherently higher commitment, with the benefit of a culture that seeks to eliminate interruptions and unnecessary bureaucracy.

As a bonus, I will be working on a company that leads the way for software conception and development, and that is shaping the modern workplace as a whole.

All that definitely sums up to the type of challenge I am looking for.

<h2>Why me</h2>

I’ve worked in several Android apps for mobile, tablets and a fridge! I have even contributed to an iOS app once in my current job, which gave me more insight on the goods and odds of both ecosystems. I am really into doing things right for each platform and it’s not different with Android.

While developing for the Android, I usually find my way around very quickly, as the past projects required many different APIs, like push notifications, networking, alarms, XML parsing, widgets, just to name a few. I don’t (and probably shouldn’t) know each and every package and class on the Android SDK from the top of my mind, but I sure know my references.

I am just as productive working remotely as in an office, or even better at home if the office is a crowded, loud open space - and that is another reason I’m applying to a job at Basecamp. I also consider myself a good communicator, have a sense of priority and am self-motivated (provided I have clear goals or the flexibility to propose changes and improvements on the product I'm working at). If required, I’m able to travel to the US to attend at events - already got a business visa and have been there once.

I enjoy programming per se, sometimes even done things at home, as freelancer or for myself. Unfortunately, I didn’t dedicate time to build a nice profile of open source contributions, but that is a fault that I assume and I intend to change.

People actually like working with me (from what they written about me on Linkedin):

“Fernando has been a great mentor for me, always patient and willing to share all his knowledge and technical expertise. He can work very well under pressure and deal with responsibility. Also he has great solutions for problems, always thinking ahead.”
A former engineer at C.E.S.A.R, now Lead Software Engineer somewhere else

“Fernando was and still is a great friend and mentor, has great technical expertise and also knows how to deal with people. He knows how to handle situations that require big decisions and work ​​under pressure. He keeps in mind that a professional should be valued for their merit and individuality. A professional who is always a step forward.”
Another former colleague at C.E.S.A.R, now Technology and Innovation Leader at his venture

“I had the pleasure and luck of working with Fernando Padoan in a project at Makesys, as he is a professional with exceptional level of excellence and with great interpersonal skills. Highly recommended.”
Former colleague at Makesys Business Technology

“Working with Fernando was always a pleasure. He knows how to deal with responsibility and time pressure. His excellent software development basis made him an very good software developer, and very good learner! I had the amazing opportunity of interviewing him for this job, and also working with him.”
Former lead engineer and mentor at C.E.S.A.R


It’s time to hire a Fernando.
Let that be me ;)


<i>BTW, nice to see that telepresence robot here! That took me a while to recognize...</i>


Thanks for your time!
